Project created with Unity3D and C#. Maze generation with _'Hunt and Kill'_ algorithm.

## Abstract
> Educational computer game that implements
a procedurally generated 3D maze intelligently populated with trigger points that trigger
questions when the player collides with them. While traversing the maze, the user will
find several trigger points with questions whose correct answers will lead to a better score.
The work aims to select appropriate methods for generating mazes and trigger points to
improve the user experience, motivate players using standard video game mechanics and
use the benefits of active learning.

## Tech

Solutions used to create this project:

- Unity3D, version 2020.3.4f1
- WebGL, for the build
- C# as a coding language
- Protobuf for client-server communication
- UniTask as async/await implementation
- DOTween for simple animations
- 
Not part of this repository:
- ASP.NET for server side
- Postgres as a database solution
- Python and multiple libraries for AI adaptive module
- Vue.js for web management portal

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
on GitHub.
